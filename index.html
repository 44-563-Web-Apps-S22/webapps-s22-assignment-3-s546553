            <h2>Recomemmeded sports activities</h2>
            <p>In recent decades, sport as a social practice has become relevant in many different fields: in health, economy, politics, education, work and leisure. The importance of sport transcends the confines of the sports field. Sport involves not only organization but also organizing. Sport is about organizing collective efforts and performance. Sport is about managing excellence, coaching and developing tactics as well as strategies. Sport also has its own mechanisms of organizing social differences. The competitive aspects of sport imply practices of in- and exclusion.</p>

            <h2>Data Structures - Sparse Tables </h2>
            <blockquote cite="https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/sparse-table.html">Sparse Table is a data structure, that allows answering range queries. It can answer most range queries in , but its true power is answering range minimum queries (or equivalent range maximum queries). For those queries it can compute the answer in  time.

                The only drawback of this data structure is, that it can only be used on immutable arrays. This means, that the array cannot be changed between two queries. If any element in the array changes, the complete data structure has to be recomputed. </blockquote>
